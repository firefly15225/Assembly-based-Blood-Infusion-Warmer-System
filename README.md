<h1 align="center">Advanced Blood Infusion Warmer System</h1>

This project presents an advanced blood infusion warmer system incorporating precise temperature management capabilities. It integrates a microcontroller, temperature sensor, heating element, and a digital display. Users can set and monitor the desired infusion temperature through an intuitive interface, adjusting heating levels dynamically to maintain optimal conditions. Real-time temperature updates are displayed on the digital screen, ensuring accurate control throughout the infusion process. The system's firmware, designed for reliable operation, ensures consistent and safe warming of blood products. This system provides healthcare professionals with a reliable tool for maintaining precise temperature control during blood transfusions.
